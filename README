SysConfig.pm
------------

Designing an operating system installer can be a fairly daunting and complex
task.  There are a myriad of ways to install a computer including installing
a set of packages, a set of files (such as from a tarball) or even straight
bit-for-bit disk imaging. 

Ultimately, however, each one of those installation methods have a number of
different pieces of common configuration data, such as network address
settings, mouse and keyboard settings or even file partitioning schemes.

SysConfig.pm is not a system installer, but rather it is an object class
with methods which provide a uniform way of describing how to install a
system.  Ultimately you can use one of the SysConfig classes such as
SysConfig::Kickstart or SysConfig::XML which will describe all of the bits of
system configuration necessary to get an installer up and running.
